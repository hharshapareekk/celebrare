In this Flutter task, I am focused on crafting a user-friendly interface for text editing within a rectangle. The objective is to ensure ease of interaction for users. The interface includes accessible options for font type, size, and color adjustments, allowing users to customize their text effortlessly. Additionally, a feature to add more text boxes is provided for expanded content. The implementation of undo and redo functionalities enables users to rectify mistakes seamlessly. The developer's aim is to equip users with comprehensive tools for precise and effortless text editing.
